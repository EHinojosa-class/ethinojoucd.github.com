    <p>As I started writing down points/ideas, I found myself drawing from other students' ideas about creating spaces for 
        certain topics to be shared. As I finished this map, I narrowed my idea to talk about mental health and how we can visualize
        exisiting data to destigmatize the topic. I also want to address technology and mental health and how we can make the digital
        landscape a safe space for such conversation.
