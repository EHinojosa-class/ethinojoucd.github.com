            <p>Seize the Awkward's website has some interactive elements that users can utilize to navigate through the campaign's services.
                There are drop down elements for navigation of different areas of the website, scroll-down elements that emphasize the messages provided
                by the campaign, and unique unique navigation. Although there are using ways interactivity is used to provide the messgage of destigmatizing
                conversations around mental health, there is not statistical data that users can interact with. I think this will be a much better website and campaign.

            <p>WoeBot is an app that allows users to track their mental health progress using CBT and DBT coping skills. The app tracks the users mood daily, how often they
                practice coping skills, and places them on a graph to show how the user's progress is. This is an exceptional application because there is some data being 
                integrated and graphed for analytical evaluation.
