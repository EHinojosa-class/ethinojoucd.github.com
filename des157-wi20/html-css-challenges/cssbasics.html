                <h2>Inheritance in CSS</h2>
                <p>Inheritance refers to how a property inherits its value from the parent property. For instance, if a previous property has 
                    a color of blue, and you want the next property to be blue as well, adding the "inherit" keyword will give that new property
                    the same color as the last.</p>

                <h2>Specificity in CSS</h2> 
                <p>Specificity refers to how specific a rule is in CSS. There are given elements in HTML/CSS that are commonplace (main, body, header, footer, etc.) However,
                    if you want to make a rule for a specific portion of a property, like the paragraph only in the main, you would specify in CSS "main p". This cascades what is being altered 
                    because of how specific it is. Compound selectors uses different selectors to be more specific. Becasue of this, it has more priority than other methods. Multiple selectors combines selectors 
                    with the same declaration and groups them.

                <h2>ID and Class Attributes</h2>
                <p>ID values are used for special elements. Becasue of this, you can only use one ID. Unlike IDs, you can assign multiple classes to different elements. Classes are used to place elements 
                    in their own section for CSS. Both IDs and classes allow for specificity of different elements.  </p>
